# MM-GAN: Missing MRI Pulse Sequence Synthesis using Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Network 

This repository contains source code for MM-GAN: [Missing MRI Pulse Sequence Synthesis using Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8859286). MM-GAN is a novel GAN-based approach that allows synthesizing missing pulse sequences (modalities) for an MRI scan. For more details, please refer to the paper.

## How to Run
In order to run the code, we recommend that you use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution. We provivde an environment.yml file that can be used to recreate the exact same Python environment that can be used to run this code.

Once Anaconda is installed, simply do:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Download BRATS2018 dataset from the official website https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html and extract both the Training and Validation zip files to a folder, say:

```
/local-scratch/data/BRATS2018/Training/
    /local-scratch/data/BRATS2018/Training/HGG
    /local-scratch/data/BRATS2018/Training/LGG
```
Validation patients do not have HGG/LGG labels. 
```
/local-scratch/data/BRATS2018/Validation/
```

Open `modules/configfile.py` and change the following paths to match your folder structure:

```
config['data_dir_prefix'] = os.path.join(mount_path_prefix, 'BRATS2018_Full/') # this should be top level path
config['hdf5_filepath_prefix'] = os.path.join(mount_path_prefix, 'BRATS2018/HDF5_Datasets/BRATS2018_Unprocessed.h5') # top level path
config['hdf5_filepath_prefix_2017'] = os.path.join(mount_path_prefix, 'scratch/asa224/Datasets/BRATS2017/HDF5_Datasets/BRATS.h5') # top level path
config['hdf5_combined'] = os.path.join(os.sep.join(config['hdf5_filepath_prefix'].split(os.sep)[0:-1]), 'BRATS_Combined_Unprocessed.h5')
config['hdf5_filepath_cropped'] = os.path.join(mount_path_prefix, 'BRATS2018/HDF5_Datasets/BRATS2018_Cropped_Normalized_Unprocessed.h5') # top level path
```

Once done, switch to the conda virtualenv, and run:

`python modules/create_hdf5_file.py`

Once it's finished, run:

`python preprocess.py`

You should have two HDF5 datasets now, one of which is raw BRATS2018 dataset, and one that is cropped to coordinates. 

In order to train MM-GAN on HGG data do:
```sh
./mmgan_hgg.sh
```

Similarly for training on LGG data:
```sh
./mmgan_lgg.sh
```
And it should start the network training process.
